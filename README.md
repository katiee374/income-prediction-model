# Income Prediction Model
## Description:
In this project, I explore different model types and hyperparameter values using scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, and numpy to find the optimal model settings to predict whether income
is greater than or less than \\$50,000. This is a binary classification problem. I am using data from the U.S. Census, which I clean and format appropriately prior to model training. I tested 
logistic regression, Random Forest, and a simple neural newtwork using keras.

## Outcome:
The final models were all able to achieve about 84% accuracy with optimal hyperparameters. In the future, continuing with feature selection and testing other model types could result in higher 
accuracy values.

## To See The Model
If you'd like to try testing the models yourself, download the code from this repository. Ensure you have scikit-learn and keras available on your machine. These packages can be downloaded from 
their respective websites.
